  <div class="about">
    <p>
      Welcome! I‚Äôm <strong>Jos√©</strong> ‚Äî the kid sitting down with pen and paper in the photo above. I'm an engineering grad student and the guy behind
      <strong>LifeLoggerz</strong>. I‚Äôm obsessed with optimizing my time and turning variable actions into clean,
      repeatable systems. When I'm not working or pursuing my other hobbies, I build <strong>Google Sheets dashboards, Python tools, and routines that make research (and life)
      more efficient.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>üéì How Did This All Start?</h2>
    <p>
      When I was younger, I kept stacks of notes and filled whiteboards trying to organize ideas. It was chaos since I was <strong>constantly moving ideas and thoughts, rewriting the same old info.</strong>
      In <strong>January 2023</strong>, I began logging simple stats in Google Sheets as a self-improvement project after reading some Reddit posts showcasing simple Excel sheets.
      By <strong>July 2023</strong>, I realized that I could <strong>organize my entire mind in spreadsheets.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      Check out the <strong>2023, 2024, and 2025 raw data sheets</strong> for insight into how these systems evolved.
      I had <strong>no professional experience with Excel or Google Sheets before</strong>, so I learned formula by formula. Formulas gave way to formatting, and then I learned how to use Google Apps Script and APIs to automate processes. 
      It only takes <strong>5 minutes</strong> for me to log my essential stats, and my diary log can take much longer. However, logging has become second-nature. Doesn't matter how beat or tired I am ‚Äî <strong>it's gotta get done.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>üìä LifeLoggerz Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Small habits compound. I initially tracked only hours slept and my 3 daily meals, but that evolved into the current tracking of <strong>over 150 stats</strong>. 
      These include sleep, food, health, work hours, study logs, music, books, and even ‚Äúblunders‚Äù in Google Sheets. Over time, these logs became a personal operating system ‚Äî <strong>a way to make decisions
      based on data.</strong> LifeLoggerz shares the templates and code so you can borrow what helps and <strong>build your own systems.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>üõ† Tools & Systems I Share</h2>
    <ul class="centered-list">
      <li>Google Sheets templates and dashboards for daily life and research</li>
      <li>Python apps for analysis, visualization, and exports (Excel/PowerPoint)</li>
      <li>Templates, checklists, and routines that reduce friction</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üé∏ And Just What Do You Actually Do With The Time Gained From All This Optimization?</h2>
    <p>
      For months, the optimization of my Google Sheets and Python apps was my one hobby and personal goal ‚Äî <strong>nothing else mattered.</strong> 
      All my free time was poured into these projects. Every spare minute, I was thinking about new features and functionalities.
      However, I eventually hit a wall of diminishing returns.
      Of course there's an optimum amount of life-tracking, and I think I reached the peak of what can reasonably and usefully be tracked in May 2025.
      I realized my systems didn't need constant upgrading. I've taken a more relaxed stance now, balancing work on these projects with my other hobbies.
      When I‚Äôm not elbow-deep in research or spreadsheets, I‚Äôm usually practicing flamenco guitar, listening to audiobooks (while I drive, wash, mow the yards ‚Äî any menial task really), running, learning languages, 
      or spending time with my family. Optimization created the space; now I fill it with enriching hobbies.
    </p>

    <h2>üå± Why This Blog Exists</h2>
    <p>
      For the past <span id="years-since" data-start="2023-01-01">{yearsLabel}</span>, I've given impromptu demos of my systems to people.
      <strong>Publishing them here allows you to interact with these systems directly.</strong>
      If you‚Äôre curious about tracking your habits, streamlining research, or building your own life-OS, you‚Äôre in the right place.

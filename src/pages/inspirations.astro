    <em>LifeLoggerz</em> didn't come out of nowhere. This all started in January 2023 when I began to keep track of my sleep and diet daily using Google Sheets. 
    This experiment eventually snowballed into <strong>everything</strong> this site presents today. I want to highlight the people and projects that made this all possible.

  {/* 1. Phil Von Stade */}

    <h2>🎥 Phil Von Stade — The Original Life Logger</h2>

    </a>
    <p>
      I thought the kind of life-logging that I was doing with spreadsheets was something unique until I found
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2yIGGxg52A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Phil Von Stade’s video</a> from 2012. Of course there's 'life loggers' like Gordon Bell who track EVERYTHING 24/7, but I find spreadsheets the most efficient means for tracking what matters in your life.

  {/* 2. Efficiency Is Everything */}
  <section class="inspo">
    <h2>⚡ Efficiency Is Everything</h2>
    <a href="https://efficiencyiseverything.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      <SectionHero
        src="/images/efficiency_is_everything.png"
        alt="Efficiency Is Everything site"
      />
    </a>
    <p>
      <a href="https://efficiencyiseverything.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Efficiency Is Everything</a> was one of the first blogs that changed how I thought about time and optimization.
      The creator breaks down things like the <strong>cheapest foods per calorie</strong> and how much time you lose on daily tasks like </strong>tying your shoes or tending your bed.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>This mindset kindled my rush to save time since we all only have 24 hours a day.</p>

  {/* 3. Michael Phelps */}
  <section class="inspo">
    <h2>🏊 Michael Phelps and Journaling</h2>
    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6131365/2025/02/20/michael-phelps-journals-to-find-the-best-version-of-himself-when-i-tried-it-the-results-surprised-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

    <p>
      Even world-class athletes do it.
      After reading
      <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6131365/2025/02/20/michael-phelps-journals-to-find-the-best-version-of-himself-when-i-tried-it-the-results-surprised-me/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> this article about Michael Phelps</a>,
      this, I realized that technology can take this up a notch.
    </p>
    <p>You know what Google Sheets has over journaling?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You can <strong>Ctrl + F</strong> for specific thoughts or entries.</li>
      <li>You can <strong>see the data evolve</strong> over time.</li>
      <li>A full year can be analyzed in minutes — and you still have every log.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That’s when I knew structured journaling could become something bigger.</p>

    <p>
      <a href="https://perfice.adoe.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Perfice</a> is a minimal life-tracking app.
      I could build something similar one day — but for now, I enjoy the <strong>interactivity and transparency</strong> of my Google Sheets systems.

      blew my mind. The design made the raw data feel <strong>alive</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feel free to improve on my systems in the <strong>aesthetics department</strong>.
      I haven’t explored Looker Studio or Power BI yet, but visual storytelling is high on my list for future upgrades.

      This GitHub project introduced me to RainDrop, a service that helps with keeping a gallery for covers of your media (books, art, albums, etc). Check out those pages in the header.

  <h2>💬 Final Thoughts</h2>
  <p>
    You think you can do better? Try </strong>Looker Studio</strong>, </strong>Power BI</strong>, or any tool I haven’t explored yet.
    I avoid deep biometrics for now — calories, bathroom breaks, etc since I track what I feel is important. That might be different for you.

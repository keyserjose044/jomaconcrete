## 🧠 What It Is

The **Research Paper Fill-In Template** is designed for fast, structured paper summaries that make your literature review **searchable, comparable, and visually memorable**.  
Each box has a purpose — to help you extract *only what matters* from a paper, and to recognize patterns between different studies at a glance.

---

## 🧩 Template Overview

Each page is structured around **information density** and **visual segmentation** — so every field contributes to a quick mental snapshot of the study.

### 🏷 Header Section
- **Date & Session Info:** When and how long you read the paper.  
- **Paper ID:** Your own indexing number (e.g., `#046`, `2023`).
- **Title & Authors:** Copy exactly or abbreviate.
- **Institution / Country / Page Count:** Adds quick bibliographic context.

### 📜 Abstract Box
A short bullet-point summary of the **core claim** and **key findings**.  
Use two colors: black/blue for neutral content, red for limitations or errors.

### ❓Problem / 💡Solution
Summarize the research gap and its proposed fix in one short line each.  
Think of these as your *elevator pitch* for the paper.

### ⚙️ Procedures and Testing
Condense methods (e.g., *“TGA 5–800 °C, XRD 5°/min”*) into shorthand notations.  
Boxes include:
- **Materials** and **Mix Designs**
- **Testing Methods / Equipment**
- **Variables** (independent & dependent)
- **Key Standards (ASTM / ISO)**

### 📈 Results & Figures
Sketch or annotate key graphs.  
Use icons to denote techniques — e.g., 🧪 TGA, ⚡ XRD, 📊 HOH, 🧱 Strength.

### 🧩 Takeaways
List the *three to five* insights or implications you want to remember.  
For example:
- Biochar increases Ca(OH)₂ conversion by 9%.  
- FA + SEM synergizes → CO₂ uptake ↑.  
- Retardation at low w/b but early strength recovery.  


## 🧭 How to Use It

1. **Print a stack** or open in a tablet note app (GoodNotes / OneNote / iPadOS).  
2. **Write fast** — don’t polish sentences. Focus on keywords, formulas, and relationships.  
3. **Highlight key terms**:  
   - Blue = facts  
   - Red = problems  
   - Black = structure  
4. **File scanned pages** into your *Research Paper Archive* in Drive or your `Research_Log` sheet.  
5. Link each entry with a matching ID in your Google Sheet database.

## ✍️ Why It Works

- Forces compression → you remember better.  
- Visual layout activates spatial memory.  
- Built for **pattern recognition** across many papers.  
- Pairs perfectly with your **Google Sheets Research Archive**, allowing structured data extraction (Title, Materials, Standards, Results, etc.).

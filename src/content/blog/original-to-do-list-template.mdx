## 🗓️ What It Is

The **Weekly To-Do List Template** is a simple yet powerful layout designed for tracking tasks across the week while keeping long-term projects and personal goals in sight.  
Each section gives you just enough space to stay intentional without feeling cluttered.

## 🧭 Template Overview

### 📅 Days of the Week
Seven daily panels — **Monday through Sunday** — each with lines to record:
- Top priorities or to-dos  
- Short notes or reminders  
- Optional time blocks or events  

This format helps visualize the flow of your week and spot overloaded days early.

### 🎯 Projects & Goals
Two dedicated boxes at the bottom of the page:
- **Projects:** Ongoing work, study, or creative tasks that span multiple days.  
- **Goals:** Personal or professional objectives you want to focus on this week.

Use this space for higher-level direction, not day-to-day errands.

### 💬 Quote Section
A small open area for your favorite **motivational quote** — perfect for weekly reflection or inspiration.  
(You can rotate between your own sayings, book lines, or Bible verses.)

## 🧠 How to Use It

1. **Print a fresh sheet each week** — or duplicate digitally in OneNote, Notability, or Google Docs.  
2. Start your week by filling in the **Projects/Goals** first.  
3. Add key tasks and reminders to each day — aim for *3–5 high-impact items* only.  
4. Use the **Quote** box to anchor your mindset.  
5. At week’s end, review what got done, what slipped, and carry over remaining items.

# From Paper Piles to ChatGPT‑Powered Google Sheets — Welcome to LifeLoggerz 📊✨

**Subtitle:** How I turned scattered notes into an automated habit-tracking, lab-logging, life-analyzing Google Sheets system — and how you can, too.

---

Hi — I’m **Jose** (23), a civil‑engineering PhD student and the person behind **LifeLoggerz**. This site started because I love designing systems. What began as sticky notes and whiteboards turned into interconnected Google Sheets that track labs, habits, music, moods, and more.

Below is a cleaned, blog‑ready explanation of how LifeLoggerz grew, why I keep building it, and how you can replicate (or simplify) any part of this system.

---

## Why LifeLoggerz? (Short version)

- I used to end up with towers of paper, half‑finished notebooks, and scattered ideas.
- Obsidian and note apps didn’t give me the same flexible structure + live calculations.
- Google Sheets gives me both: spreadsheets that think (formulas + scripts) and dashboards that tell stories.
- Also — designing the system scratches the same itch as solving a good engineering problem.

> **Am I overboard?** Maybe. **Is it working?** Definitely. LifeLoggerz is my life, and I enjoy it.

## The evolution (V1 → V3)

| Year | Version | Big changes |
|---:|:---|:---|
| **2023** | **V1** | Manual logs: sleep, food, basic habits |
| **2024** | **V2** | Added dozens of variables: moods, symptoms, work contexts, music listening |
| **2025** | **V3** | ChatGPT + Google Apps Script automation, HTML form input, dynamic dashboards |

*(I’ll add screenshots of V1 & V2 in the gallery — they show the slow, iterative design process.)*

---

## What I track (hundreds of variables)

A non‑exhaustive list so you get the idea:

- **Health & sleep:** bedtime, wake time, nap yes/no, sleep hours, dreams, symptoms
- **Work & research:** lab batches, mix designs, experiment metadata, time spent on coding/PPTs
- **Habits & routine:** Duolingo, guitar practice, treadmill minutes, morning routine ticks
- **Personal life:** meals, social visits, clothing choices, gratitude / blunders log
- **Media & learning:** books listened, classical pieces by date, Raindrop.io saved links
- **Misc:** location logs, who I saw, daily weather, mood tags

---

## Key benefits (why this is worth the hours)

1. **Self‑insight:** discover patterns that actually matter (e.g., how naps affect lab focus)
2. **Automation:** one HTML form can update multiple sheets in a single submission
3. **Scalability:** dashboards and formulas scale from tens to tens of thousands of rows without rewriting logic
4. **Shareability:** export charts, share templates, or onboard teammates quickly
5. **Creative flow:** designing the system becomes a productive hobby

---

## Roadmap — what’s next for LifeLoggerz

- Finish packaging the unified **Stats Log** modal (HTML + GAS) so anyone can drop it into a sheet.
- Add real‑time alerts (e.g., boss leaves office → suggestion to take a break).
- Enable a SQL backend + Power BI for heavier analytics and cross‑sheet joins.
- Publish a how‑to series: templates, Apps Script snippets, and ChatGPT prompt recipes.

---

## ChatGPT prompt examples I use (copy/paste friendly)

**Mood & energy classification**

```text
Analyze the diary text in cell D5:
- Return tone: Positive | Neutral | Negative
- Return energy: High | Medium | Low
Write the outputs to columns H and I respectively.
```

**Automatic Raindrop bookmarking**

```text
Given title in C2 and author in E2, search Goodreads (or the web), find the canonical book URL, and add it to my Raindrop collection with tags: #reading #books.
```

**Daily summary generator**

```text
Summarize today’s key entries: sleep, top work items, one learning, one blunder, and one gratitude. Keep it ≤ 80 words.
```

## Inspirations & Resources

- **Template:** Stats Log HTML + GAS (download link coming)  
- **Guide:** Connect ChatGPT ↔ Google Sheets — step‑by‑step (coming)  
- **Examples:** Dashboard patterns and chart templates (coming)

## I won’t gatekeep — want help?

I’ll gladly share templates, Apps Script snippets, or help you design a lightweight version that fits your life. Reply in the comments, DM me, or sign up for the LifeLoggerz newsletter.

## Questions for you (let’s talk)

- Do you track anything obsessively? What tools do you use?
- How has tracking changed your habits or productivity?
- Has anyone taken tracking to the extreme like this — or am I alone?

## Extra: copyable snippets for sharing

**SEO meta (paste into site/head)**

- `title`: LifeLoggerz — From Paper Piles to ChatGPT‑Powered Google Sheets
- `description`: How a PhD student built an automated Google Sheets system to track research, habits, music listening, and daily routines. Templates, scripts, and ChatGPT prompts included.

**Social share text**

- X/Twitter: “I turned my life into Google Sheets — from sleep & labs to music and moods. Here’s how I built LifeLoggerz and how you can too. 📊✨ [link]”
- Mastodon: “LifeLoggerz — my experiment in living with spreadsheets. Templates & prompts coming soon. Open to DMs for help!”

**Suggested featured image idea**

- A tidy screenshot collage: left = 2023 hand notes, center = V2 sheet, right = V3 dashboard (alt text: “Evolution of LifeLoggerz: paper → sheets → dashboard”)

If you want, I can:

- Paste this as a ready‑to‑publish Markdown file with frontmatter formatted for your site (done).
- Create a “starter pack” folder (template sheet, Apps Script stub, prompt examples) you can import.
- Write the first tutorial: **Install the Stats Log modal in 10 minutes** with code and screenshots.

Which of those do you want next? I can start the starter pack or the tutorial — your call.
